This is pretty much like the Windows minesweeper game.  You run the program, and you will be asked to choose a difficulty.
After you do so, you will be presented with the game.  Click on the smiley face at any point and your game will start over.
If you click the file menu on the top left, you can change the difficulty or view high scores, a couple of mine should already be there.
If you click the help menu, you will have the option to view a hint.
